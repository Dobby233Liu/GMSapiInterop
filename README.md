# GMSapiInterop

Microsoft SAPI interop for recent GameMaker (2024.6+) using recent .NET (8+). Weird mix between old tech and new tech I know, also Windows-only.

The demo object is almost all documentation for the time being

As this is still pretty rough, plus I just did it for the funnies, please consider carefully whether you want to use this in a game you'll ship, especially if you focus on a11y. Here's an promising alternative: https://github.com/Gannio/GMSTolkTalk

## TODO

* More detailed docs
* Intergrate SAPI into GM audio mixer
